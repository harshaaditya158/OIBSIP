            <b>PERSONAL LIFE</b><br><br>
            Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician born in present day Tamil Nadu. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became obvious and known to the wider mathematical community, centered in Europe at the time, he began a famous partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy. The Cambridge professor realized that Ramanujan had rediscovered previously known theorems in addition to producing new ones.

            <b> EDUCATION</b><br><br>
            At age 15 Srinivasa Ramanujan obtained a mathematics book containing thousands of theorems, which he verified and from which he developed his own ideas. In 1903 he briefly attended the University of Madras. In 1914 he went to England to study at Trinity College, Cambridge, with British mathematician G.H. Hardy.

                <b> CAREER</b><br><br>
                Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan made contributions to the theory of numbers, including pioneering discoveries of the properties of the partition function. His papers were published in English and European journals, and in 1918 he was elected to the Royal Society of London.

                <b>ACHIEVEMENTS</b><br><br>
                Circle Method: Ramanujan, along with GH Hardy, invented the circle method which gave the first approximations of the partition of numbers beyond 200. This method contributed significantly to solving the notorious complex problems of the 20th century, such as Waring's conjecture and other additional questions.
